## Process

### IDEA
Sketches are made with R.
#### ITERATION I
This iteration is to show the summary of the [entire statistic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i97Uo1Rt5T6i1D2ruDZ2vsC31fs9SWoyI9F7kyzH1dA/edit#gid=1884522291). <br />

#### ITERATION II
Based on Iteration I, it shows the top three dominant countries are United States, France, and Russia. Within these three subsets, I wanted to present the overall trend of each country. <br />

#### ITERATION III
From the raw data, it was interesting to find that some nuclear tests were conducted underground while the others were conducted aboveground. Iteration III presents the trend of how many tests were conducted underground and aboveground through time. <br />
